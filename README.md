## ScrapingAttractionsFromGoogle

#  You will never have to wonder "What am I going to do on Vacation?" again. 

This objective of this python project is to scrape attractions from Google with Selenium. It uses Googles https://www.google.com/travel/things-to-do? to pull results from a list of cities that you must find or create. 

# You will need:

# Python
I really like PyCharm at the moment but I use IDLE a lot too. 

# Selenium
pip install Selenium

With Pycharm click Python packages in the bottom left corner. Type in selenium, and you can install it from there.

# Pandas
pip install Pandas


With Pycharm click Python packages in the bottom left corner. Type in pandas, and you can install it from there.

# Chrome Webdriver
You should download this from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Make sure it matches the version of chrome you are running. You can find this by pasting into your chrome search bar chrome://settings/help

This works too with other webdrivers. You may have to modify the code a bit. 

# First create a list of cities and save it as a csv file.
You may need to edit line 67 so that your naming convention agrees. Make sure the file is in the path.
